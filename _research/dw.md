collection: research
---


This page is devoted for everything you need to know about the work that I am presenting at Dynamic Walking 2020. 
I will mainly present the most recent work of our lab on locomotion over soft terrain. 
You can find all the publications, presentation slides, and poster in this page. 
If you need anything else, feel free to contact me via email, twitter or wherever you can reach me.

# Outreach:

- You can pretty much find most of what I am doing on this website.
- For more information about the DLS lab, visit the [dls website](https://dls.iit.it/).

- You can also see the other work of my lab such as:
  - [MPC-based Controller with Terrain Insight for Dynamic Legged Locomotion.](https://iit-dlslab.github.io/papers/villarreal20icra.pdf)
  - [On the Hardware Feasibility of Nonlinear Trajectory Optimization for Legged Locomotion based on a Simplified Dynamics.](https://iit-dlslab.github.io/papers/bratta20icra.pdf)
  - [Stance Control Inspired by Cerebellum Stabilizes Reflex-Based Locomotion on HyQ Robot](https://iit-dlslab.github.io/papers/urbain20icra.pdf)

- For the latest [highlights of our work on HyQ Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqHh0AGm-D4&t=20s).
