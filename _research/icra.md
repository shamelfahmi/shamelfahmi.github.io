Here you can find everything you need to know about 
our work on locomotion over soft terrain
that is presented at ICRA 2020. 
You can find all the publications, presentation slides, and poster in this page. 
If you need anything else, feel free to contact me via email, twitter or wherever you can reach me.

# Outreach:

- You can pretty much find most of what I am doing on this website.
- For more information about the DLS lab, we dedicated a web page for all our [ICRA outreach](https://dls.iit.it/icra).
- For the latest [highlights of our work on HyQ Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqHh0AGm-D4&t=20s).
- How about the [DLS lab's Twitter](https://twitter.com/iitDLSLab)?
