## Overview
Whole-body Control (**WBC**) has demonstrated remarkable result in dealing with multiple tasks while reasoning about the  the robotâ€™s dynamics, actuation limits and interaction with the environment. It emerged as an important framework in locomotion control for legged robots. 

However, most of **WBC** frameworks fail to generalize beyond rigid terrains. Legged locomotion over soft terrain is difficult due to the presence of unmodeled contact dynamics that **WBC**s do not account for. This introduces uncertainty in locomotion and affects the stability and performance of the system.

To this end, we propose a novel soft terrain adaptation algorithm called **STANCE**: **S**oft **T**errain **A**daptation a**n**d **C**ompliance **E**stimation. **STANCE** consists of a **WBC** that exploits the knowledge of the terrain to generate an optimal solution that is contact consistent and an online terrain compliance estimator that provides the **WBC** with terrain knowledge. 

**STANCE** can adapt online to any type of terrain (stiff or soft) without pre-tuning. As a result, HyQ was capable of adapting its locomotion strategy and remain contact consistent. **STANCE** allows HyQ to traverse multiple terrains with different compliances and to transition between them.
