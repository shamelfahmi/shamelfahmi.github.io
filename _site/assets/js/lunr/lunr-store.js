It emerged as an important framework in locomotion control for legged robots. However, most of WBC frameworks fail to generalize beyond rigid terrains....","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Overview Our goal is to achieve dynamic locomotion over challenging unstructured terrain. This requires reasoning about the robot’s dynamics, actuation limits and interaction with the environment. To do so, we exploit optimization techniques in locomotion control to formulate a Whole-Body Control (WBC). WBC is a motion tracking controller that is...","categories": [],
