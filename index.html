<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
My name is Shamel, I am a roboticist that is broadly interested in providing robotics-oriented solutions to current real-world challenges. 
I focus mainly on making robots walk. 
This requires reasoning about the robot's surrounding environment using its on-board perception, 
and developing on-line strategies using controls, optimization, and learning. 
Feel free to navigate through my website, and to reach out to me via my email or through the socials.
