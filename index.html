<h1>Welcome!</h1>
Shamel Fahmi is a roboticist that is interested in providing robotics-oriented solutions to current real-world challenges. 
He focuses on making robots walk. 
This requires reasoning about the robot's surroundings using its on-board perception, 
and developing on-line strategies using controls, optimization, and learning. 
Currently, he is a postdoc at the Biomimetic Robotics lab of MIT.

<h1>:collision: Featured News! :collision:</h1>
I recently joined the <a href="https://biomimetics.mit.edu/">Biomimetic Robotics lab</a> as a postdoc.
I intend to focus on vision-based locomotion for legged robots. Reinforcement Learning and Controls along the way!!
