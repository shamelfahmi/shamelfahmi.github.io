  **I'm looking for Students!** <br>
  I am looking for master students (for an internship or thesis) to work with me
  at the DLS lab on Whole Body Control for Legged Robots. 
  For more information, visit this [link](https://iit-dlslab.github.io/internship-positions/soft_terrain_passivity.pdf) for my own topic or this [link](https://dls.iit.it/open-positions/bsc-msc-phd) for open positions at the DLS lab.
