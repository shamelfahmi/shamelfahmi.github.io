## FAQ
Pronouncing my name is supposed to be easy, at least according to my dad. 
It's not a common name though (not even in Egypt), so here we go:
Shamel (شامل) means "inclusive" or "complete" or "comprehensive".
You should pronounce it as "Schämel" with a German "Sch" and "ä".
Fahmi (فهمي) comes from the verb fahima which means "to understand".
You should stress on the "h".
If you're lost, you can pretty much prounounce my first name like you'd pronounce [Chanel](https://www.chanel.com/), but with an "m".
