## Me in a Nutshell

I'm a doctoral researcher at the [Dynamic Legged Systems](dls.iit.it) (DLS) lab of the [Italian Institute of Technology](iit.it) (IIT). My main research is in Quadrupedal Locomotion Planning and Control.
I received my M.Sc. in Systems and Control: Robotics and Mechatronics in September 2017 at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/) (UT). 
I did my master thesis at the [Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.ram.ewi.utwente.nl/) (RaM) lab at UT.
During my master studies I worked at the [Robotics and Mechatronics Center](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/) at the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/) (DLR).
I received my B.Sc. in Mechatronics in July 2015 at the [German University in Cairo](http://www.guc.edu.eg/).
I did my bachelor thesis at the [Institute of Automatic Control](http://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de) (IRT) at [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de).
During my bachelor studies I also worked at the [Insisute of Automotive Engineering](https://www.ika.rwth-aachen.de/en/) at RWTH Aachen.

## FAQ
Pronouncing my name is supposed to be easy, at least according to my dad. 
It's not a common name though (not even in Egypt), so here we go:

Shamel (شامل) means "inclusive" or "complete" or "comprehensive".
You should pronounce it as "Schämel" with a German "Sch" and "ä".
Fahmi (فهمي) comes from the verb fahima which means "to understand".
You should stress on the "h".
