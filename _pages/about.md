## FAQ
Pronouncing my name is supposed to be easy, at least according to my dad. 
It's not a common name though (not even in Egypt), so here we go:

Shamel (شامل) means "inclusive" or "complete" or "comprehensive".
You should pronounce it as "Schämel" with a German "Sch" and "ä".
Fahmi (فهمي) comes from the verb fahima which means "to understand".
You should stress on the "h".
