Whole-body Control (WBC) can achieve multiple locomotion tasks while respecting the robot’s dynamics. However, most of WBC frameworks fail to generalize beyond rigid terrains. Over soft terrain, the stability and performance of the legged robot deteriorate if the WBC is not accounting for the introduced uncertainty due to the soft contact interaction.  To deal with this, we propose a novel soft terrain adaptation algorithm called STANCE: Soft Terrain Adaptation and Compliance Estimation. STANCE consists of a WBC that exploits the knowledge of the terrain to generate an optimal solution that is contact consistent and an online terrain compliance estimator that provides the WBC with terrain knowledge.

In dynamic locomotion, it is essential to consider the robot’s dynamics, actuation limits and interaction with the environment. To do so, we exploit optimization techniques in locomotion control to formulate a Whole-Body Control (WBC). WBC is a motion tracking controller capable of achieving multiple locomotion tasks while respecting the robot’s behavior.
